# hello-world
For LIS 161

HEEEEEEEEEEY!

I'm Lea. I'm tiny but I like really scary stuff. Horror or thriller kind of scary, not socially scary stuff (e.g. reporting, giving a speech). I'm still working on that. I watch YouTube videos a lot. Sometimes educational ones, but let's plays most of the time.

I'm generally a happy person, and I like making people laugh.

I also would like to try extreme sports in the future.
